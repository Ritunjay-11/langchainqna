# Discovering inconsistencies: A deep dive with OpenAI models

Industry evolves fast. Clients discover new opportunities every week.
You are a partner in achieving their goals.
Requirements and change-requests are coming in thick and fast.

With every adaptation, you wonder if it could contradict something you've already done.
With growth in clientele, there is no single person who understands all workflows.
Elegant reports with five columns are slowly turning into 20-column jungles.

Sounds familiar? Numocity is a player in such a field.

Numocity makes SaaS products for Electric Mobility providers.
It's a rapidly evolving field where clients are trying to find their business, in their own individual journey.

In the quest for a single product code-base, Numocity needs to prevent the requirements from turning into a multi-header monster.

This project aims to provide early warnings on requirements that tend towards inconsistency.
