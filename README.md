# Discovering inconsistencies: A deep dive with OpenAI models

Industry evolves fast. Clients discover new opportunities every week.
You are a partner in achieving their goals.
Requirements and change-requests are coming in thick and fast.

With every adaptation, you wonder if it could contradict something you've already done.
With growth in clientele, there is no single person who understands all workflows.

Sounds familiar? Numocity is a player in such a field.

Numocity makes SaaS products for Electric Mobility providers.
Requirements evolve constantly, with each client in their own journey to find their business.

In the quest for a single product code-base, Numocity needs to prevent the requirements from turning into a multi-headed monster.

This project aims to offer warnings, when product-management authors requirements that may bring inconsistency.
